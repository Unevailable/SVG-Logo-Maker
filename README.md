## Installation
I first started by creating a git repo, after that I pulled the repo onto my repos folder and created the necessary files and folder for the project. I proceeded to install jest and Inquirer and then started building up a skeleton code in my index.js using code from the previous challenge. I worked on the shapes.js and shapes.test.js. When that was done I polished the index.js ran the program and made minor adjustments based on the outputs. Lastly, I recorded the program and then pushed the changes to github using gitbash. 

## Usage
to use it you want to head to the directory of the file and in git bash or cmd prompt you type node index.js to start the program. It will give you prompts for you to input an answer for example "Enter up to three characters." you would input three characters and hit enter. Afterward, it will generate an SVG Logo.

## Contributing
I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help check for errors in my code other than that there were no other contributors.

## Tests
The project results showed a working program that generated an SVG logo. The visual results are located in the examples folder.
